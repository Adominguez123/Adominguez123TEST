<h1>My Hobbies! </h1>

<p> Below are a few of my hobbies that I enjoy in my spare time. </p>

<h2> Film Studies </h2> 

<p> I have always been a massive fan of media studies, but no other art form has captured my attention and analytical eye more than cinema. Ever since childhood, I have always been entranced by the incredibly intricate way films combine multiple facets of creative art. Broadly, the combination of visual storytelling, music, writing, and countless other trades makes the medium one unlike any other (saying nothing of the literal <b>thousands</b> of specialized roles that films could employ). While I am relatively inexperienced when it comes to professional-level film production, I have made several short films and ameture pieces with friends throughout my life, and a few of the courses I have taken at the University of Wisconsin-Madison have strengthened my skills behind the camera. Many more, however, have fostered my love for film criticism and film analysis. While in many ways, a critic’s work is very easy, I cannot deny the fulfillment I get from exploring, analyzing, and writing about films and film theory. Some of the films that opened my eyes to the magic of cinema are <i>La La Land</i>, the original <i>Star Wars films</i>, <i>Her</i>, and <i>Y tu Mama Tambien</i>. But with each of the films that I see, I am reminded of the care, creativity, and passion that goes into making cinematic art. I hope that through analysis and exploration of this art, I can further deepen not just my understanding of film itself, but the lessons and wonders it can teach us all. </p> 

<h2> LEGO </h2>

<p> Ever since childhood, my favorite toy has been <i>LEGO</i>. The way that those little plastic bricks can open up a child’s eyes to the <b>endless</b> possibilities of their imagination is truly something special, and the countless houses, spaceships, and castles I built out of LEGO as a child helped to foster the creative side of my personality. I created entire worlds, stories, and characters from my small collection of bricks, and I cannot deny the profound effect such creative expression had on my development. While I moved away from voicing my minifigures and acting as if I lived in their world, my love for collecting and building with LEGO has only gotten stronger. While I don’t play with the toy in the traditional sense anymore, I absolutely play with it in terms of expressing my imagination. I continue to build intricate sculptures and models, and the challenge that comes with figuring out just which part should go where is a puzzling process that I simply cannot get enough of. I collect many official sets and figures, and adding to my collection has become my primary physical hobby. While many might tell me to simply grow up and out of the toy, I think that LEGO’s ability to provide me with a creative and mentally stimulating outlet for expression has actually helped me grow more than I ever could have imagined.</p> 

<h2> Swordplay </h2>

<p> While I have never been the best at most physical sports, the meditational practice of swordplay has been my primary physical hobby ever since I was a kid. Admittedly inspired by the action heroes of my childhood and the coolness of swordplay in films like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, my self-taught skills with traditional melee weaponry have taken on a much more mature role in my life. Whenever I am stressed, overwhelmed, or even overcome with happiness, being able to swing a beautifully carved Bo Staff or perfectly crafted Bokken has allowed me to be mindful of my physical surroundings and feel connected to them. Being conscious of the space around me, the weapon itself, and my own body has had a very positive impact on my mental health. The philosophy of swordplay has also taken on an interesting role in my life - mindfulness, honor, and humility are all inherently related to the practice, and that connection inspires me to pursue those qualities every time I pick up a sword. While I have never truly been taught by an expert, and I would never pretend to consider myself an expert, my personal development of my skills with the sword have taught me much about myself and the world around me.</p> 

<h2> Drives </h2>

<p> During the warmer parts of the year, if I have the time - and the gas money - there is simply nothing better than packing into the car with some friends, and going for a drive on the beautiful Wisconsin back-roads. The peak of such an experience is on a warm summer evening, in which I can take the top and the doors off of my Jeep, Jesibelle. While I’m really not much of a serious car guy, the simple joy and sense of freedom I get with the wind blowing through my hair and the sun in my eyes is unparalleled. The freedom that the road gives me always manages to help me relax, center myself, and remember that everything is going to be okay. It’s a simple pleasure, but being able to slow down and enjoy life in such a way never ceases to amaze me. </p>
