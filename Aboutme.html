<p>I was born in Sheboygan, Wisconsin as my parentsâ€™ second child. My older brother and I went to our elementary school right across the street, and we grew up close to our loving extended family. As a kid, I had an interest in baseball and played in the local rec leagues, and made many friends that I still keep up with today. As I grew up, I moved away from sports and took on a greater love for art and media - I ate up books, movies, television, and video games, and did so with a critical eye. Throughout high school, I became close with other people who loved analyzing media and appreciating art, and took classes and joined clubs that focused around such things. After I was enrolled at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, I decided to further those interests by majoring in Communication Arts, with specific interest in Radio, Television, and Film studies. I am also pursuing a certificate in Digital Studies, as a way to further round out my interest in art and media in the ever-growing digital age. In the future I hope to find a career in communications and media.   </p>
